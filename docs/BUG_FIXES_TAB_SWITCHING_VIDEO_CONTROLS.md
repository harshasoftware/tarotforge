# Bug Fixes: Tab Switching and Video Controls

This document details the fixes implemented to resolve issues with modal interactions and video controls after tab switching, as well as participant count display issues.

## Issue 1: Modals Not Opening After Tab Switch

### Problem
When users switched browser tabs or moved focus away from the window and returned, modals (such as the invite modal) would not open when clicking buttons.

### Root Cause
After a tab switch, some browsers interfere with pointer events or React's event system, preventing normal interactions from working properly. The event listeners and pointer events can become disabled or stale.

### Solution

#### 1. Window Focus/Blur Event Listeners
**File:** `src/pages/reading/ReadingRoom.tsx` (lines 182-199)

Added event listeners to detect when the window regains focus and forcefully re-enable pointer events:

```typescript
// Add focus event listener to re-enable interactions after tab switch
const handleWindowFocus = () => {
  console.log('[Focus] Window regained focus, re-enabling interactions');
  // Force a re-render to ensure event listeners are properly attached
  document.body.style.pointerEvents = 'auto';
};

const handleWindowBlur = () => {
  console.log('[Blur] Window lost focus');
};

window.addEventListener('focus', handleWindowFocus);
window.addEventListener('blur', handleWindowBlur);
```

#### 2. Enhanced handleShare Function
**File:** `src/pages/reading/ReadingRoom.tsx` (lines 2205-2209)

Added pointer-events check at the start of the share function:

```typescript
const handleShare = async () => {
  console.log('handleShare called, sessionId:', sessionId);

  // Ensure pointer events are enabled (in case they were disabled after tab switch)
  if (document.body.style.pointerEvents === 'none') {
    console.log('[handleShare] Re-enabling pointer events');
    document.body.style.pointerEvents = 'auto';
  }

  if (!sessionId) {
    console.log('No sessionId, returning early');
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of function
}
```

#### 3. Improved Button Click Handlers
**File:** `src/pages/reading/ReadingRoom.tsx` (lines 2903-2907, 3190-3194)

Enhanced invite button handlers with explicit event handling and pointer-events:

```typescript
// Before
<button onClick={() => handleShare()}>

// After
<button
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    handleShare();
  }}
  style={{ minHeight: '36px', pointerEvents: 'auto' }}
>
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Modals open reliably after tab switching
- ✅ All interactive elements remain functional
- ✅ Proper event propagation control
- ✅ Explicit pointer-events guarantee interactions work

## Issue 2: Video Bubble Hover Controls Not Visible

### Problem
The video bubble hover controls (microphone, camera, and exit buttons) were not visible or clickable after switching tabs and returning to the app.

### Root Cause
After the pointer-events fix for modal issues, the video control buttons inside hover overlays didn't have explicit pointer-events settings and weren't properly handling click events, causing them to be blocked or non-responsive.

### Solution

#### 1. Control Overlay Enhancements
**File:** `src/components/video/VideoBubbles.tsx`

Added explicit pointer-events and z-index to all control overlays:

```typescript
// Before
<motion.div
  className="absolute inset-0 bg-black/50 flex items-center justify-center gap-1"
>

// After
<motion.div
  className="absolute inset-0 bg-black/50 flex items-center justify-center gap-1 z-10"
  style={{ pointerEvents: 'auto' }}
>
```

#### 2. Button Click Handler Improvements

All control buttons were enhanced with proper event handling:

```typescript
// Before
<button onClick={toggleAudio} className="...">
  {isAudioEnabled ? <Mic /> : <MicOff />}
</button>

// After
<button
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    toggleAudio();
  }}
  className="..."
  style={{ pointerEvents: 'auto' }}
>
  {isAudioEnabled ? <Mic /> : <MicOff />}
</button>
```

#### 3. Fixed Controls in All Views

**Expanded View (Grid Layout):**
- Local video controls (lines 874-932)
  - Microphone toggle
  - Camera toggle
  - Exit call button
- Remote participant controls (lines 1001-1044)
  - Audio control
  - Video control

**Minimized View (Floating Bubbles):**
- Local video controls (lines 1136-1198)
  - Microphone toggle
  - Camera toggle
  - Exit call button
- Remote participant controls (lines 1304-1346)
  - Audio control
  - Video control

### Benefits
- ✅ All video controls visible on hover
- ✅ Controls remain functional after tab switching
- ✅ Proper z-index layering
- ✅ Clean event handling with no bubbling issues

## Issue 3: Video Call Participant Count Display

### Problem
The `GuestVideoJoinModal` component was showing "2 people" when there was only 1 person in the video call.

### Root Cause
The component was receiving `participantCount` (which represents remote participants only) but was displaying it directly without adding 1 for the local user who is about to join.

### Solution
**File:** `src/components/video/GuestVideoJoinModal.tsx` (lines 9, 99)

#### 1. Added Documentation to Interface
```typescript
interface GuestVideoJoinModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  onJoin: () => Promise<void>;
  participantCount: number; // Should be videoCallParticipants.length (NOT +1, as this is only remote participants)
  hostName?: string;
  sessionInfo?: {
    layout?: string;
    question?: string;
    step?: string;
  };
}
```

#### 2. Fixed Display Logic
```typescript
// Before
{participantCount} {participantCount === 1 ? 'person' : 'people'} in video call

// After
{/* participantCount is remote participants count, +1 for yourself when you join */}
{participantCount + 1} {participantCount + 1 === 1 ? 'person' : 'people'} in video call
```

### Explanation
- `participantCount` = number of remote participants already in the call
- When the guest joins, they become part of the call too
- Display shows: `participantCount + 1` (remote participants + yourself)

**Example:**
- If 1 person is already in the video call → `participantCount = 1`
- Display shows: `1 + 1 = 2 people` ✓ Correct!

### Benefits
- ✅ Accurate participant count display
- ✅ Clear documentation for future developers
- ✅ Consistent with other video components

## Testing Recommendations

### Tab Switching Test
1. Open a reading session
2. Click the invite button to open the modal
3. Switch to a different browser tab
4. Wait 5+ seconds
5. Return to the reading session tab
6. Click the invite button again
7. **Expected:** Modal opens successfully

### Video Controls Test
1. Start a video call
2. Hover over the video bubble (desktop) or tap (mobile)
3. **Expected:** Controls appear (mic, camera, exit)
4. Switch to a different tab
5. Return to the app
6. Hover/tap the video bubble again
7. **Expected:** Controls still appear and are clickable
8. Click each control button
9. **Expected:** Each button functions correctly

### Participant Count Test
1. Join a video call with 1 other person
2. Check the participant count in any modals or UI elements
3. **Expected:** Shows "2 people"
4. Add a third person
5. **Expected:** Shows "3 people"

## Related Issues

These fixes resolve the following user-reported issues:
1. "I'm unable to open any modals if I move out of the window or tab and come back into the app"
2. "The video bubble on hover controls to end microphone and camera are not visible now from previous commit"
3. "This count is always showing 2 even though there is just 1 person"

---

## Technical Notes

### Pointer Events Strategy
The fix uses a multi-layered approach:
1. **Document level:** Re-enable on window focus
2. **Component level:** Check and re-enable in critical functions
3. **Element level:** Explicit `pointerEvents: 'auto'` on interactive elements

### Event Handling Best Practices
All interactive elements now follow this pattern:
```typescript
onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();      // Prevent default browser behavior
  e.stopPropagation();     // Stop event bubbling
  actualHandler();         // Call the actual handler
}}
style={{ pointerEvents: 'auto' }}  // Ensure element can receive events
```

### Z-Index Hierarchy
Current z-index values:
- Video bubbles: `z-50`
- Control overlays: `z-10` (relative to parent)
- Invite modal: `z-[200]`
- Video chat panel: `z-50` / `z-[100]`

---

## Future Considerations

1. **Monitoring:** Add analytics to track how often pointer-events need to be re-enabled
2. **Browser Testing:** Test across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. **Mobile Testing:** Verify touch interactions work on iOS and Android
4. **Performance:** Monitor if frequent focus/blur events impact performance
