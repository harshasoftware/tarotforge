# Wallet Debug Steps - Quick Fix Guide

## Immediate Actions to Take

### Step 1: Check Console Logs
1. Open your browser DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Refresh your profile page
4. Look for these emoji logs:

**Expected logs when page loads:**
```
üîê authStore: Starting wallet backfill check for user: <your-id>
üí≥ WalletDashboard: Checking for wallets for user: <your-id>
üí≥ WalletDashboard: Found wallets: [...]
```

**If you see:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è WalletDashboard: No wallets found for user
```
‚Üí Your account doesn't have wallets yet. Proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Use Manual Wallet Creator Button

I've added a **debug button** to your Wallet Settings page.

1. Go to **Profile ‚Üí Scroll to "Wallet Settings"**
2. You'll see an **amber/yellow warning box** at the top
3. It says: "Debug: Manual Wallet Creation"
4. Click the button: **"Create Wallets Now"**
5. Wait for success message
6. Page will auto-refresh after 2 seconds
7. You should now see "Reveal Wallets" button!

---

### Step 3: Check Database Directly (If Button Fails)

Open your **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Check if you have wallets
SELECT * FROM user_wallets WHERE user_id = '<your-user-id>';

-- Check identity mapping
SELECT * FROM user_identity_mapping WHERE supabase_user_id = '<your-user-id>';
```

Replace `<your-user-id>` with your actual user ID (you can find it in console logs or Supabase Auth users table).

**Expected results:**
- `user_wallets`: Should have 2 rows (Solana + Base)
- `user_identity_mapping`: Should have 1 row with privy_did

**If empty:**
‚Üí Wallets were never created. The manual button should fix this.

## Debugging Checklist

### ‚úÖ What to Check:

1. **Privy App ID is set:**
   ```bash
   # Check .env file
   cat .env | grep VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID
   ```
   Should show: `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=clz...` (not empty)

2. **User is logged in:**
   - Check console for: `user:` object in logs
   - Profile page should show your username

3. **Database tables exist:**
   - Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'public'
   AND table_name IN ('user_wallets', 'user_identity_mapping');
   ```
   Should return both table names.

4. **RLS policies allow inserts:**
   ```sql
   -- Check if service role can insert
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies
   WHERE tablename IN ('user_wallets', 'user_identity_mapping');
   ```

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Create Wallets Now" button does nothing

**Possible causes:**
- Privy service not initialized
- Network error
- Missing environment variables

**Fix:**
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID` is set in `.env`
3. Check Network tab for failed requests

### Issue 2: Button says "Wallets already exist" but nothing shows

**Possible causes:**
- Wallets exist but WalletDashboard query is failing
- RLS policy blocking reads

**Fix:**
1. Check console logs from WalletDashboard
2. Run SQL query directly in Supabase:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_wallets
   WHERE user_id = '<your-id>';
   ```
3. If you see wallets, it's an RLS issue. Check your RLS policies.

### Issue 3: Console shows "Wallet backfill failed"

**Possible causes:**
- Privy service error
- Invalid email
- Network timeout

**Fix:**
1. Look at the full error message in console
2. Check if privyService.ts is working:
   ```typescript
   import { privyService } from './services/privyService';
   // Test in console
   ```
3. Use manual button instead of automatic backfill

## What the Logs Mean

### Good Logs (Everything Working):
```
üîê authStore: Starting wallet backfill check for user: abc-123
üîê Creating silent wallet for user: abc-123
‚úÖ Wallet created: { solana: 'ABC...', base: 'DEF...' }
‚úÖ 2 wallets stored successfully
‚úÖ authStore: Wallet backfill completed successfully
üí≥ WalletDashboard: Checking for wallets for user: abc-123
üí≥ WalletDashboard: Found wallets: Array(2)
‚úÖ WalletDashboard: User has 2 wallet(s)
```

### Bad Logs (Something Wrong):
```
üîê authStore: Starting wallet backfill check for user: abc-123
‚ùå authStore: Wallet backfill failed (non-blocking): Error: ...
üí≥ WalletDashboard: Checking for wallets for user: abc-123
‚ö†Ô∏è WalletDashboard: No wallets found for user
```
‚Üí Use manual button to force creation

---

## Quick Test Script

Run this in your browser console on the profile page:

```javascript
// Check if user is loaded
console.log('User:', window.__SUPABASE_USER__); // If this shows

// Force check for wallets
const { supabase } = await import('./lib/supabase');
const user = useAuthStore.getState().user;
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('user_wallets')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id);

console.log('Wallets in DB:', data);
console.log('Error:', error);
```

## Next Steps After Fixing

Once wallets are created:

1. ‚úÖ You'll see "You have 2 blockchain wallets ready to use"
2. ‚úÖ Click "Reveal Wallets" button
3. ‚úÖ See your Solana and Base addresses
4. ‚úÖ Copy addresses or view on block explorers

The manual button is just for debugging - **remove it** once everything works by deleting:
- `<ManualWalletCreator />` from `WalletSettings.tsx`
- The `ManualWalletCreator.tsx` file

## Contact/Support

If none of this works:
1. Check all console logs and copy them
2. Check Supabase logs for errors
3. Verify Privy dashboard shows your app is active
4. Share console logs for debugging

---

**TL;DR:**
1. Go to Profile ‚Üí Wallet Settings
2. Click the amber "Create Wallets Now" button
3. Wait for success + page refresh
4. Enjoy your wallets! üéâ
