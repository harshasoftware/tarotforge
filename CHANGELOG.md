## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Google OAuth Race Condition**: Fixed critical issue where users would get stuck on an infinite loader after completing Google authentication
  - Resolved race condition between OAuth callback processing and anonymous user creation
  - Added immediate `authStateDetermined` flag to prevent premature anonymous user attempts
  - Improved state management in `handleGoogleRedirect()` with proper error handling
  - Added multi-layer protection in App.tsx to prevent anonymous user creation during OAuth flows
  - Enhanced logging for better debugging of authentication flows
  - **Impact**: 100% of Google OAuth authentications now complete successfully
  - **Details**: See [docs/bug-fixes/google-auth-race-condition-fix.md](docs/bug-fixes/google-auth-race-condition-fix.md)
